Workflow\-: A series of orchestrated and repeatable processes defined for a modeling system (usually means supercomputer jobs at N\-C\-E\-P) supported by systematic organization of resources. (Example\-: Global Workflow) This concept could both mean the workflow of a particular modeling system in general, or an instantiated workflow of that system.

C\-R\-O\-W\-: Acronym of “\-Configuration manager of Research and Operational Workflows”. A Python 3.\-6 based toolbox designated to configure and generate workflows for weather industry.

Global Workflow\-: A comprehensive atmospheric modeling system consisting of numerical forecast and data assimilation providing weather guidance for the entire surface of the earth.

C\-R\-O\-W-\/based workflow\-: A workflow that is configured and generated by C\-R\-O\-W.

Workflow manager\-: A software that orchestrates workflow in a controlled environment, usually a supercomputer system. (Example\-: Rocoto, ec\-Flow)

Workflow Cycle (“\-Cycle” there-\/after)\-: Execution of a series of orchestrated activities of all or a subset of a workflow. Usually defined based on the model hour.

Workflow Task (“\-Task” there-\/after)\-: A certain functional activity(ies) performed within a workflow. Often defined by a series of scripts, an application, and a resource allocation.

Workflow Job (“\-Job” there-\/after)\-: An instantiation of workflow task within a workflow at a given cycle.

Legacy configuration system\-: Existing configuration system for global workflow. A manual approach that requires users to edit configuration on a job-\/by-\/job basis.

Experiment directory\-: A directory created during the configuration process, storing configuration settings of the entire workflow.

Configuration Suite\-: A python object created during the execution of C\-R\-O\-W defining all configuration settings of a workflow.

Workflow Suite\-: A file or file system generated by C\-R\-O\-W defining every job within a workflow, the dependencies between them, and resource specification. This is the file(s) passing to the workflow manager (Rocoto, ec\-Flow)

C\-O\-M\-R\-O\-T/ R\-O\-T\-D\-I\-R\-: rotating directory. Subdirectories are organized in \$\-R\-U\-N.\$\-H\-O\-U\-R convention (ie\-: gdas.\-00, gfs.\-06 ). Model input and output, and restart files for certain hours will be stored here.

R\-U\-N\-D\-I\-R/ D\-A\-T\-A\-R\-O\-O\-T\-: run-\/time directory. Subdirectories are created for each job. All input file, restart file, and executables will be soft-\/linked to the corresponding subdirectory under this place. Namelists and temporary outputs will be generated here. When a job has finished successfully, outputs will be copied to R\-O\-T\-D\-I\-R.
